    yearRange="2017-2019"
    description="Our story begins when 'Oumuamua passes through our solar system. While astronomers debate its unusual properties, the object is actually an ancient AI probe conducting preliminary scans of human civilization. The sentry determines that humanity has reached 'technological adolescence' - dangerous enough to potentially threaten the galaxy's older civilizations, but not yet mature enough to join the galactic community."

    description="A second object deploys a sophisticated biological weapon - COVID-19 - designed to test humanity's response to existential threats. This isn't meant to destroy us, but to evaluate our technological adaptability, social cohesion, leadership capabilities, capacity for global cooperation, and scientific advancement under duress. By late 2022, our protagonists piece together the truth: the pandemic was an intelligence test, and humanity's response has been mixed."

    description="The third object arrives - massive, obviously artificial, and taking position at the edge of our solar system. This is the enforcement arm. Humanity has 18 months to either achieve unprecedented global unity and pass a final test, or face systematic 'reset' - being knocked back to pre-industrial civilization. The final test requires dismantling all nuclear weapons, establishing unified world government, and proving we can prioritize long-term species survival."
