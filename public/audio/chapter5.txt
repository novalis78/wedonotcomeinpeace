"But we haven't been visited," Jessica interjected, her voice carrying the sing-song tone of someone reciting received wisdom. "Right? I mean, there's no evidence of alien contact." Several students snickered, and Marcus could see Brad making exaggerated "alien" gestures with his hands.

"That's the paradox," Marcus replied, trying to maintain his composure as more students began to giggle. "The numbers suggest that we should have been visited, but we haven't observed any clear evidence of visitation. Fermi famously asked, 'Where is everybody?'"

"Maybe they saw Earth and decided to keep driving," Brad called out, triggering a wave of laughter from the back of the room.

But Tommy wasn't laughing. "So what are the actual numbers? I mean, if the math says we should have been visited, what does the math say?"

Marcus began writing on the whiteboard, his handwriting cramped but legible. "The galaxy is about 13.6 billion years old. It contains roughly 400 billion stars. Even if only a tiny fraction of those stars have planets, and only a tiny fraction of those planets develop life, and only a tiny fraction of those develop intelligence, you're still talking about potentially millions of civilizations."

"But that doesn't mean they can travel between stars," Jessica said, though her tone had become more serious. "Interstellar travel is impossible, right?"

"Not impossible," Marcus replied. "Difficult, expensive, time-consuming, but not impossible. Even with our current technology, we could build generation ships that could reach other star systems in a few thousand years. But here's the key pointâ€”even if a civilization could only travel at one percent of the speed of light, they could colonize the entire galaxy in just a few million years."

The room fell quiet except for the hum of fluorescent lights. Marcus could see that some students were actually thinking about the implications, while others were still waiting for the next opportunity to mock him.
