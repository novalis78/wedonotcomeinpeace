The air in the auditorium of the Beijing Institute of Technology was a peculiar mixture of stale, recycled coolness and the electric warmth of three thousand bodies, a palpable hum of anticipation that Wei Jian recognized instantly. It was the same energy he’d felt in stuffy university server rooms in the late nineties, the same crackle that preceded the launch of a new product line, the same thrum of a thousand minds focused on a single, improbable point on the horizon. He was, as always, invisible. Dressed in a simple, dark grey polo shirt and nondescript trousers, he looked like any other mid-level engineer, perhaps a department head from a provincial university, someone who had saved for months to attend. His face was placid, his posture relaxed. Only the slight, almost imperceptible wear on the bespoke leather of his shoes hinted at a different reality.

Wei Jian was a ghost in his own country. A name whispered in the highest echelons of tech and finance, but a face known to almost no one. Decades ago, as a young man with nothing but a ferocious intellect and an even more ferocious hunger, he had developed a suite of predictive logistics algorithms that had, without fanfare, become the silent, beating heart of global supply chains. He had sold the core patents through a labyrinth of shell corporations headquartered in the Cayman Islands and Singapore, making himself a billionaire many times over before he was thirty. He had then vanished from public life, preferring the quiet anonymity of a modest apartment in Chengdu to the gilded cages of Shanghai or Shenzhen. He found that true power, the kind that could reshape the world, didn't roar; it calculated, it built, and it waited.

And today, he was waiting for Robert Zubrin.

He scanned the crowd. It was a fascinating cross-section of the new China. In the front rows sat the Party officials, their postures rigid, their dark suits a uniform of sober importance. They were here because space, particularly Mars, was a matter of national prestige. Their faces were polite masks, betraying a dutiful interest rather than genuine passion. Behind them, the professional class: engineers from the China National Space Administration, academics from Tsinghua and Peking University, their expressions a mix of professional curiosity and critical analysis. They were the builders, the ones who would translate ambition into orbital mechanics and thrust-to-weight ratios.

But it was the students, filling the vast middle and upper sections of the hall, who held Wei’s attention. They were young, their faces bright with an unvarnished, almost holy zeal. They clutched worn copies of The Case for Mars, some in English, some in the newly translated Mandarin. They wore t-shirts with the Mars Society logo. They were not here for prestige or career advancement. They were here because they were believers. They saw, as Wei did, that the future was not a linear extrapolation of the present, but a branching path, and the most important branch led… elsewhere.
